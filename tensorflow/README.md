#Feature Visualization for Convnets in Tensorflow

This is the code to accompany a post on [Visualizing Features from a Convolutional Network](http://kvfrans.com/visualizing-features-from-a-convolutional-neural-network/).

##Instructions for running:

Download the [cifar10 binary format](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), place into /cifar-10-batches-py directory

run `main.py`

run `conv.py` to compile many image files into the group ones shown in the post
